** DONE citadel background test <2019-04-30 Tue>
** DONE drug screen test <2019-04-30 Tue>
** DONE voting <2019-05-04 Fri>
** DONE resignation letter <deadline: 2019-05-03 ping>
How to approach HBK resignation? What is my current strategy? The date
they want to start 6/10. I hope HBK can have me until 6/3? That will
be very good.

There are so many things going on at once. I will need to think about
it. Need to be calm. Take it easy. Take it slow.
I like emacs more and more. There is a thing or two in emacs
that I need to learn. Learn to be more efficient. Learn to work hard.
Learn to be calm.

Waiting for Ross's reply by tomorrow.
Stay at HBK till end of May. Start at citadel in June.
No defer, no prorated bonus.
