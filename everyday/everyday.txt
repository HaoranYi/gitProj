How to approach HBK resignation? What is my current strategy? The date
they want to start 6/10. I hope HBK can have me until 6/3? That will
be very good.

There are so many things going on at once. I will need to think about
it. Need to be calm. Take it easy. Take it slow.
I like emacs more and more. There is a thing or two in emacs
that I need to learn. Learn to be more efficient. Learn to work hard.
Learn to be calm.

Waiting for Ross's reply by tomorrow.
Stay at HBK till end of May. Start at citadel in June.
No defer, no prorated bonus.

* A high frequency market making algorithm			    :FINANCE:
- limit order book
- two sided markets for a specified list of equities
- managing inventory, reducing risk of adverse selection by changing the rate
  of inventory accumulation dynamicallly
- dynamically adjusts the range of the bid-ask spread, with the aim of
  minimizing inventory level on market close
- make use of estimates of recent market trends and adjust the bid-offer spead
  to lean in the direciton of the tread
- a manual adjust factor allows the market-maker to nuge the algorithm in the
  direction of reducing inventory.

Use queuing theory to model the order arrival
Use indifference price (parametered on the size of the book)

Here is the 2008 paper on using limit order as market maker
[[https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/HighFrequencyTrading.pdf][paper]]. Modelling with the limit price for profit.
