** TODO resignation letter
How to approach HBK resignation? What is my current strategy? The date
they want to start 6/10. I hope HBK can have me until 6/3? That will
be very good.

There are so many things going on at once. I will need to think about
it. Need to be calm. Take it easy. Take it slow.
I become more and more like emacs. There is a thing or two in emacs
that I need to learn. Learn to be more efficient. Learn to work hard.
Learn to be calm.

Waiting for Ross's reply by tomorrow.
