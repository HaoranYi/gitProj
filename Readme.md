# This is a test project.

cloud9 is a web-dev environment:

    - project linux environment
    - can choose to have the vi mode when editiong the code
    - a linux terminal 
        - run any command (i.e. make, git etc)
        - can compile and run the code in terminal
    - integrated into gitub
        - clone directly from gihub project
        
This vim mode works well in safari browser. but not so well in chrome. i need to figure out why.
